For Gmail API access we need credentials.json and token.json. Also we need to enable Gmail API through https://console.cloud.google.com. 
We can get the credentials.json file after creating a project folder in the link provided. 

For the langchain access, we used OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com. 

We must add the OpenAI API key and credentials.json to the project folder in order to run the project.

Both credentials.json and OpenAI API key are confidential and unique to the programmer. Caution!!!: Don't share it to anyone.
